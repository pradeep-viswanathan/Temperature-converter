# Temperature Converter

This project is a responsive Temperature Converter website created as part of my internship. It dynamically converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using JavaScript’s `oninput()` function for real-time conversion.

## Features

- **Real-Time Conversion**: Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin instantly as values are entered, using JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes without requiring media queries.
- **Clean Interface**: Simple and user-friendly layout for a smooth user experience.

## Skills and Tools Learned

- **HTML**: Structured layout with form elements for input fields
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, accessible interface
- **JavaScript**: `oninput()` function for real-time updates and conversion logic
